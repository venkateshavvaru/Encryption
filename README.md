# Encryption
We can encrypt the data the sender sends the data to the receiver and receiver sends the data to the sender both values must 
be equal then only data is safe. The values are not equal then someone hack our data. By using diffie-helman algorithm and 
ASCII the interest for mystery expanded drastically also, a wide range of new cryptographic systems developed.
